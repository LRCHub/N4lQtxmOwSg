What do you have in store?
One life away,
you can't explore
But I don't want to get
in the way no more
'Cause this the type
of feeling you can't ignore, ay
I'm ready to break
down the door, settle the score
I can't let you go away
I miss the smile off your face
You know that
I lo-lo-lo-love the chase
You told me once
that I was crazy
I said "Baby girl I know,
but I can't let you go away"
So don't you get me started now
I want a yes,
I don't want maybe's
'Cause they leave me
where you found me
So don't leave
Ooh,
I just love the way you
got me feeling
And now I feel it
It's like, ooh
Take away the pain
Baby, I'm healing,
baby, I'm healing
I don't need anything more
Be the wave, I'll be the shore
Crashing all over me
I want you
What do you have in store?
Type of girl that make me
drop dead on the floor
This the only girl
that I love and adore
This the type of love
that you can't ignore
I said, "Hey,
she coming my way"
She running 'round saying
whatever she wanna say
I told her I don't wanna
have to do this everyday
Told her that I love her
but she thinking it's a game
Oh, no
Now she uncomfortable
Never wanna make it
the one dimensional
(Oh, yeah-oh, nah-nah-nah)
Don't know how we got there,
don't you get me started now
You told me once
that I was crazy
I said "Baby girl I know,
but I can't let you go away"
So don't you get me started now
I want a yes,
I don't want maybe's
'Cause they leave me
where you found me
So don't leave
Ooh, I just love the way
you got me feeling
(Oh, you got me feeling)
And now I feel it
(Oh, you got me feeling)
It's like, ooh
Take away the pain
Baby, I'm healing,
baby, I'm healing
(Baby, I'm healing,
baby I'm healing)
I don't need anything more
Be the wave, I'll be the shore
Crashing all over me
I want you
